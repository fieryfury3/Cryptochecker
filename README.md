# Cryptochecker
First python project, User types the name or symbol of whichever (Top 100) coin he/she would like to get information about.
The user can also type 1h, 24h, or 7d to see percentage changes relative to time. Type "All" to see info about all the (Top 100) coins.

Any suggestions/tips/help would be greatly appreciated!
